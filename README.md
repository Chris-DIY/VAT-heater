## DIY Resin-VAT heating system with PID Control for 3D resin printers

This project describes an external heating solution for metal resin-VATs on 3D resin printers, with temperature control via an Arduino controller.
The goal is to maintain a stable resin temperature during printing, especially in cold environments and when special resin types require a higher printing temperature.

## Features
- Arduino Nano or Arduino Uno R3 - based controller
- PID control with NTC temperature sensor
- OLED display for temperature display
- Encoder for setpoint adjustment
- Heater power controlled via PWM and MOSFET
- Modular and externally mountable
