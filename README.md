# DIY Resin-VAT Heating System with PID Control for 3D Resin Printers

This project describes an external heating solution for metal resin VATs on 3D resin printers.  
Temperature is controlled via an Arduino-based PID controller using a thermistor and MOSFET-switched heater film.  
The goal is to maintain a stable resin temperature during printing – especially in cold environments or when special resins require it.
